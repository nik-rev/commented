The file [`src/generated.rs`](src/generated.rs) is generated by the [build script](script/src/main.rs) which downloads the [`languages.toml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helix-editor/helix/479c3b55847eae060b69e6f0eda0bd95d93a7fa0/languages.toml) file from Helix and turns that into Rust code.

To run the script:

```sh
cargo generate
```
